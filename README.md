This repository contains all the supporting documentation for the OSEL Regulatory Science Tool titled, "Mock Circulatory Loop to Generate Variable Adult Heart Conditions for Evaluating Mechanical Circulatory Support Devices." The following list provides information for navigating through the repository:
1. USER MANUAL: Mock Circulatory Loop (MCL) Setup and Testing (18 Pages)

  [Contains step-by-step instructions for building the MCL (including setup and operation) and simulating the target test conditions. Building the MCL involves executing steps outlined in supporting documents (specified in the order in which they need to be     executed): i) Preparation of Blood Analog Fluid (BAF) (2 Pages), ii) Pressure Transducer Calibration (4 Pages), iii) Flow Sensor Calibration (5 Pages), and iv) Filter Frequency Response Characterization (6 Pages). The USER MANUAL contains direct links to these suporting documents and journal articles by D'Souza et al., 2024, and Contarino et al., 2023.]  
3. Technical Recommendations [Contains recommendations for users who wish to use their own MCL for device testing. This document outlines guidelines for how to generate MCL test evidence in regulatory submissions in alignment with the ISO 14708-5:2020 standard.
