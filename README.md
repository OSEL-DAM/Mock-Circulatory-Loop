This repository contains all the supporting documentation for the OSEL Regulatory Science Tool titled, "Mock Circulatory Loop to Generate Variable Adult Heart Conditions for Evaluating Mechanical Circulatory Support Devices." The following list provides the repository document names in the order in which they should be accessed along with a brief description of its contents:
1. USER MANUAL: Mock Circulatory Loop (MCL) Setup and Testing
   [Contains step-by-step instructions for building the MCL (including setup and operation) and simulating the target test conditions. Building the MCL involves executing steps outlined in supporting documents (specified in the order in which they need to be executed): 'Preparation of Blood Analog Fluid (BAF)', 'Pressure Transducer Calibration', 'Flow Sensor Calibration', and 'Filter Frequency Response Characterization'. The USER MANUAL contains direct links to these suporting documents.  
3. Technical Recommendations
4.
