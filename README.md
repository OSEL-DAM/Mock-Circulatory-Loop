# Mock Circulatory Loop to Generate Variable Adult Heart Conditions for Evaluating Mechanical Circulatory Support Devices

This repository contains all the supporting documentation for the OSEL Regulatory Science Tool titled, "Mock Circulatory Loop to Generate Variable Adult Heart Conditions for Evaluating Mechanical Circulatory Support Devices."


## [USER MANUAL: Mock Circulatory Loop (MCL) Setup and Testing](USER%20MANUAL_Mock%20Circulatory%20Loop%20(MCL)%20Setup%20and%20Testing.pdf) (18 Pages)

Contains step-by-step instructions for building the MCL (including setup and operation) and simulating the target test conditions. Building the MCL involves executing steps outlined in supporting documents (specified in the order in which they need to be     executed): 

[**Preparation of Blood Analog Fluid (BAF)**](Preparation%20of%20Blood%20Analog%20Fluid%20(BAF).pdf) (2 Pages)

[**Pressure Transducer Calibration**](Pressure%20Transducer%20Calibration.pdf) (4 Pages)

[**Flow Sensor Calibration**](Flow%20Sensor%20Calibration.pdf) (5 Pages)

[**Filter Frequency Response Characterization**](Filter%20Frequency%20Response%20Characterization.pdf) (6 Pages)
  
The USER MANUAL references these suporting documents and the journal article by [**D'Souza et al., 2024**](https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/biomechanical/article/146/1/011004/1169328/Using-a-Mock-Circulatory-Loop-as-a-Regulatory).


## [Technical Recommendations](Technical%20Recommendations.pdf) (1 Page)

Contains recommendations for users who wish to use their own MCL for device testing. The recommendations guide users on how to generate MCL test evidence in regulatory submissions in alignment with the ISO 14708-5:2020 standard. This document references the supporting documents, [**USER MANUAL: Mock Circulatory Loop (MCL) Setup and Testing**](USER%20MANUAL_Mock%20Circulatory%20Loop%20(MCL)%20Setup%20and%20Testing.pdf) (18 Pages) and [**MCL Repeatability Testing**](MCL%20Repeatability%20Testing.pdf) (1 Page), and the journal article by [**D'Souza et al., 2024**](https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/biomechanical/article/146/1/011004/1169328/Using-a-Mock-Circulatory-Loop-as-a-Regulatory).


## [Summary of V&V Activities](Summary%20of%20V%26V%20Activities.pdf) (3 Pages)

Contains a summary of the verification and validation testing conducted for the MCL described in this RST.
